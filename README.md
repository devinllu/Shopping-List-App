# My Shopping List

Developed a shopping list android application for the SystemsHacks 2020 - LifeHacks hackathon hosted at SFU Surrey.
Capable of sorting the user's list by quantity and name, saving the current list for future reference, and many other
useful features while all in an aesthetically appealing UI.
